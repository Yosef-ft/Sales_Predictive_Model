# Sales Forecasting Project
## Overview
This project aims to develop an end-to-end machine learning solution for forecasting sales at Rossmann Pharmaceuticals. The finance team requires accurate sales predictions for all stores across several cities, specifically six weeks ahead of time. Currently, store managers rely on their personal judgment and experience for these forecasts, which can lead to inconsistencies.

## Objectives
- Build a Predictive Model: Utilize historical sales data and relevant factors to create a robust model for sales forecasting.
- Deliver Predictions: Provide timely and accurate sales predictions to the finance team through a user-friendly interface.
